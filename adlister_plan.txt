NOTES:

*obstacles:
	-- page controller case logic over-writing the logic in the individual pages
	-- page controller logic not running due to removal of php logic in index
	-- file directory structure changes may have caused conflict with menu-paths predefined in the templates

* immediate recommendations to resolve issues:
	-- put all the logic at the top of each page OR:
	-- add back the removed php data in each page and restructure	

* lessons learned
	-- use more time planning
	-- clearly communicate structure changes
	-- ensure still on task, more frequent check-ins
